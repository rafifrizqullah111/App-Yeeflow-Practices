# 📘 Yeeflow Learning Repository
👋 Welcome!

Hi there, and welcome to my personal Yeeflow learning repository.  
This repo is created as a structured collection of practices, experiments, and notes while I learn and explore **Yeeflow (no-code platform)** for building business applications, workflows, and automation.

It is not a production-ready project, but rather a space to keep track of my progress, organize exercises, and build hands-on experience in Yeeflow development.


# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- To document my learning journey with Yeeflow.
- To provide a centralized place for different app-building and automation practices (Forms, Workflow, Integrations, Analytics, etc.).
- To act as a personal reference whenever I revisit topics or prepare for real-world projects.
